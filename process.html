                    The focus of the week was to complete the poster by the upcoming deadline and decide on a specific theme. Ultimately, I chose the theme of "whale watching" after considering multiple complex themes and seeking inspiration from other people's designs. I then initiated research on whale watching seasons and Australian social patterns to gather the necessary data and references needed to design the website.

                    During the week I completed the design of the poster and the website, and tried to make both consistent with the chosen theme. I worked until late to complete the website but achieved a satisfactory result. In the practical class I discussed with other students and simulated the tasks of the upcoming group project.

                This week we formed teams for our upcoming projects. I actively participated in the group formation and discussions, and contributed to the selection of the project topic based on my individual work. We presented the posters produced in the previous phase and discussed the group activities outlined in the team charter. My work was selected as the theme for our team project. In the following group discussions, I focused on being friendly and open-minded, and listening more while providing positive feedback.        </p>

                    This week was a whirlwind of creativity and reflection, as I successfully completed the poster, a critical stage in our group project. The journey began with completing the poster, a task complicated by the late conception of the theme. Time constraints forced me to engage in an intense period of design work to align the poster and my website with the overall theme I had envisioned. The pressure ultimately led to an all-nighter to complete the website. While proud of the result, the experience taught me an important lesson in time management, especially for future projects where I hope to avoid last-minute sprints of work.

                <p class='contentText'>
                    In the practical class, we worked intensively on the preparations for the upcoming group project under the guidance of our tutor. The climax of the week was the formation of our project team. Discussions in class led to the signing of the team charter and the presentation of the poster last week. The course continues to be a valuable mirror that has revealed subjects I need to study further.
                    Overall, this week was full of achievements and reflections that have driven professional growth and personal development.

                    This week I started working on the project prototype and found it difficult to manage the project work while balancing tasks from other courses.

                    This week marked the beginning of our prototype development – ​​a critical phase for our project. Reflecting on the chaos of last week, I wish I had been more coordinated. However, the challenge of synchronizing timetables remained, as this was compromised by the heavy assessment requirements of other courses. This week, we had a presentation. In retrospect, while everyone put in a commendable effort, the result did not fully reflect our potential. The lack of communication within the team was evident, especially our failure to verify the completeness of everyone’s contribution, which caused our presentation to exceed the allotted time. It was clear that more cohesive teamwork was essential. We also held multiple meetings focused on identifying and defining the characteristics of our project.

                    All in all, this week’s experience highlighted the ongoing effort to balance academic obligations, the importance of effective team communication, and the need for better organizational strategies. Going forward, I am confident in fostering a collaborative and productive environment with my team, aimed at efficient communication and timely completion of tasks.

                    This week we focused on building the website and creating the corresponding MVP presentation. I
                    contributed to the project by taking on coding-related support work and working with teammates with
                    stronger IT backgrounds. I planned to find additional resources to improve my coding skills during the
                    holiday. After the MVP presentation, our team agreed that our website lacked highlights. Therefore,

                    This week I was working on making the site more interactive and interesting by adding new pages. At the

                This was a very productive week focused on adding core features to the project. Our main goal was to refine
                and present interim results, a task that was accomplished under the pressure of numerous ongoing projects in
                other classes. The group discussion took place in a friendly and collaborative atmosphere, allowing us to
                quickly reach consensus. This positive dynamic has enhanced my anticipation for future work with this team.

            <p class='contentText'>
                I spent a considerable amount of time building our website and preparing explanatory presentations. As
                someone studying interaction design, my coding skills are not that strong, so I took on a supporting role
                for code-related tasks. Thankfully, two teammates with IT backgrounds generously provided guidance, pointing
                out areas where I needed to grow on my own. Recognizing my own limitations, I focused on sharing
                responsibilities in other areas to contribute effectively.

            <p class='contentText'>
                During the team meeting, we discovered that our content lacked interactivity and engagement. I focused on
                developing a solution that would enhance interactivity while leveraging our existing website and materials.
                This process highlighted a valuable lesson: Improving a project sometimes requires drawing inspiration from
                the success of others. By anticipating future situations where similar major adjustments might be necessary,
                this experience equipped me with strategies to more skillfully address such challenges. Overall, it was a
                week of growth and learning, driven by teamwork and adaptability.

                    This marks my first project in life. It has to be said that it was an exhilarating experience.
                    Although during the project completion, time seemed to fly by, as if I hadn't had the chance to
                    savor the process before rushing into the next stage. However, reflecting now, I realize I have
                    experienced a lot.
                </p>
                <p class='contentText'>
                    Firstly, for the first time, I experienced what it's like to collaborate with people from different
                    fields to complete a project. Throughout the process, I continuously discovered my shortcomings, but
                    also my strengths.These shortcomings have shown me which areas I can improve upon, and the
                    continuous discovery of my strengths has significantly boosted my self-confidence. Secondly, by
                    completing this course, I gradually learned how an effective product creation cycle operates and
                    what each person should accomplish when in different roles. Furthermore, I gained a slight taste of
                    how a product is produced in a real company, which clarified my future career direction and enhanced
                    my confidence.However, I also have some suggestions for improvement. One of them is that the course
                    uses too many software, which increases the difficulty for students to complete assignments. For
                    example, UQCloud feels redundant to me. Secondly, although I am satisfied with the overall output of
                    the course, I also feel that the explanation of some detailed knowledge is inadequate.
                </p>
                <p class='contentText'>Overall, although there are some minor complaints, I am satisfied with my performance in completing
                    the project and the knowledge I have gained from this course.

The journey began with completing the poster, a task complicated by the late conception of the theme. Time constraints forced me to engage in an intense period of design work to align the poster and my website with the overall theme I had envisioned. The pressure ultimately led to an all-nighter to complete the website. While proud of the result, the experience taught me an important lesson in time management, especially for future projects where I hope to avoid last-minute sprints of work.</p><p class='contentText'>In the practical class, we worked intensively on the preparations for the upcoming group project under the guidance of our tutor. The climax of the week was the formation of our project team. Discussions in class led to the signing of the team charter and the presentation of the poster last week. The course continues to be a valuable mirror that has revealed subjects I need to study further.Overall, this week was full of achievements and reflections that have driven professional growth and personal development.</p></div></div>";

In retrospect, while everyone put in a commendable effort, the result did not fully reflect our potential.

One of them is that the course uses too many software, which increases the difficulty for students to complete assignments. For example, UQCloud feels redundant to me.
