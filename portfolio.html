                    Since my idea was chosen by the team members as the theme of the next team project to be completed, I can continue to use my initial design. At the beginning of this stage, I tried to refine the functions I conceived by describing the interaction of the functions in more detail. The frame on the left in the figure below shows that the user can explore the detailed area of ​​the map with the mouse in the style of a magnifying glass. The right side of the figure shows the creatures that will appear in the map.

The new page is for the game. I sketched out this page. On the left, the diagram shows a doodle of the game interface. I interspersed the content and patterns into the draft. On the right are some windows that need to be added for interaction. In the blank areas of the diagram, I noted down some content I feel should be included and explanations about what each window is meant to remind the user of.
